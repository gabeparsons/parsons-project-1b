            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Gabe Parsons is a folk singer songwriter based in New Orleans hailing from New Jersey. Inspired by his influences like Bruce Springsteen and Lord Huron, Gabe has used his time at Loyola University's Popular and Commercial Music Degree Program to hone his craft of songwriting and stage performance. He has played extensively throughout his home in the Tri-State area including New York City, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. After returning to New Orleans in August after a long hiatus Gabe quickly went about creating his current band "Gabe Parsons & the Heartland." In the last few months they have begun to make a name for themselves in the Uptown music scene. The group is set to play at several well known venues across New Orleans in the coming months. 
                In addition to playing live Gabe has two studio albums, his most recent, Cape Adare, was released last month. It was recorded throughout the duration of the pandemic. It focuses on themes of loneliness and the pursuit of dreams. It is framed in the metaphor of early Antarctic Expeditions, particularly Robert Falcon Scott's doomed terra nova trek. The record draws on these stories lyrically and sonically encapsulates the haunting beauty of the far south.
